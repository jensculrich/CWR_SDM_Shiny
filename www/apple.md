### Wild apple species distributions in a changing climate

Two wild relatives of apple are native to Canada. For each of these species, we used species distribution modeling  to determine the area of suitable habitat. We then predicted how climate change will impact the distribution of suitable habitat. Select an apple CWR species, an emissions-based climate change scenario, a time projection and a level of habitat suitability to visualize the predictions.
