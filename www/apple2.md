### Species Distribution Model Details

We modeled distribution of suitable habitat for each apple species using the MaxEnt algorithm. See [https://terrellroulston.github.io/malus/](https://terrellroulston.github.io/malus/) for more details about the species distribution modeling approach.

Two apple CWR are native to Canada. *Malus coronaria* (sweet crabapple) currently occurs in eastern Canada, especially in southern Ontario. *Malus fusca* (Pacific crabapple) currently occurs in western Canada, primarily in southern British Columbia. 

Projections are displayed for two possible emissions scenarios. ssp245 represents a middle of the road projection with high climate adaptation and low climate mitigation. ssp585 represents a scenario with low regard for environmental sustainability, increased fossil fuel reliance. ssp585 is the current tracking projection. Apple CWR species distributions attenuate and move further northwards under the ssp585 scenario.

Apple CWR species distributions are predicted to shift over the coming decades as the climate continues to warm, moving northwards from historical (pre-2020) into 2070. *Malus fusca* appears range does not shift as substantially as *Malus coronaria*, suggesting that this wild species may be more robust againts climate change pressures. 

Habitat suitability ranges from low (marginal habitat for each species) to high (optimal habitat for each species). Species occurrences are expected to be more stable in higher suitability areas.
